Introduction
QA Testing (Quality Assurance Testing) is the process of verifying and ensuring that a software product meets the required quality standards before its release. It involves identifying defects, 
ensuring functionality, and improving the overall software quality through systematic testing procedures.

Features of QA Testing
(1) Bug Detection & Prevention – Identifies defects early in the development cycle.
(2) Requirement Validation – Ensures that the software meets user requirements.
(3) Automation & Manual Testing – Uses both automated tools and manual test cases.
(4) Performance Optimization – Ensures the software runs efficiently under various conditions.
(5) Security Assurance – Identifies vulnerabilities and security risks.
(6) User Experience Testing – Enhances usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.
(7) Continuous Testing – Integrates testing into CI/CD pipelines for ongoing quality checks.
(8) Compliance & Standards – Ensures software follows industry regulations and best practices.

-> Pros (Advantages Of QA Testing)
(1) Early Defect Detection – Bugs can be fixed before deployment, reducing future costs.
(2) Better Software Quality – Ensures the software meets user expectations and industry standards.
(3) Enhanced Security – Prevents vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches.
(4) Improved User Experience – Helps create user-friendly and bug-free applications.
(5) Cost Savings – Fixing bugs in the early stages is cheaper than post-production fixes.
(6) Reliability & Stability – Ensures the software runs smoothly under different conditions.

-> Cons (Disadvantages Of QA Testing)
(1) Time-Consuming – Thorough testing takes time, delaying project completion.
(2) High Costs – Requires investment in tools, testers, and resources.
(3) Complexity – Large applications require extensive test cases and management.
(4) Not 100% Bug-Free – Even with rigorous testing, some issues may still appear.
(5) Dependency on Requirements – If requirements change frequently, testing efforts may need to be repeated.
